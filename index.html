    <p>Brazil, the largest nation in both South America and Latin America, is a country of immense diversity and global significance. Occupying nearly half of the continent, its vast territory encompasses the majority of the Amazon Rainforest, the world's largest tropical rainforest, teeming with unparalleled biodiversity. The country is also defined by its extensive Atlantic coastline, punctuated by iconic cities such as Rio de Janeiro, with its famous Christ the Redeemer statue and bustling beaches, and the economic powerhouse of São Paulo.</p>
